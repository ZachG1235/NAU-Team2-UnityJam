# Ex-traterrestrial
We were tasked to build a game around the theme of the word, ***"Creepy"***.  

We ask you, what is the most creepy thing you can think of? 

Our response: ***Men!***

## Project Overview
This game is a 3D, first-person stealth-horror where you play as a man. You see your girlfriend get taken into her house by a huge alien; a kidnapping happening right in front of your eyes! In order to save her, you must break into her house, find the key to her room, and SAVE HER! While you do this, you have to look out for the patrolling alien! Get caught, and who knows what happens to you!

This story comes with a TWIST, and you'll figure out the twist as you find "keys" to her locked room. This story might be a bit different than you expect!

  As you pick up keys throughout the house, they'll actually turn into different objects, a picture of her and another man, a phone with texts like "It's been 2 years, why won't he leave me alone", and a diary with notes about marrying someone! When you finally come to your senses and make it to your girlfriend's now <b>un</b>locked room, the truth is revealed! Your girlfriend actually BROKE UP WITH YOU TWO YEARS AGO! THE ALIEN IS HER NEW BOYFRIEND! <b>YOU ARE THE CREEP!</b>

## Development Info
This game was developed at the 1st Annual ***Arizona Game Jam in 2025***. The constraints were the following: use the Unity engine, only use the assets provided, no modifying the assets outside of Unity, follow the theme of "Creepy", and create it in 27 hours (we were given the theme at 11am on Saturday, 11/1, the deadline was 2pm on Sunday, 11/2). 

There were 10 teams competing over at the AZ Game Jam. Two teams from five universities in Arizona. The universities consisted of Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University, University of Arizona, Grand Canyon University, and the University of Advancing Technology. 

This game was developed by Northern Arizona University Team 2, consisting of five prominent Game Developers coming from diverse backgrounds:
* Zachary Garza
* Devin Jay San Nicolas
* Sage Tesoro
* Bex Cabral
* Jake Preston

Out of the 10 teams that competed for first place, all being judged by people from prominent backgrounds in the gaming industry, ***we*** were crowned the Arizona Game Jam's champions!
